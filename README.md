# Maple code base for Master Thesis: On the classification of unital C*-algebras
The file can only be run in Maple (this needs a licence, though!), but feel free to open it in any editor. For clarity open the maple_code_raw_code, since it is easy readable. Contact me in case you need information about any functions. maple_code_with_comments is best read within the Maple framework.
